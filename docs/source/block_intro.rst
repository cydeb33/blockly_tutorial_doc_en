Let's start this tutorial by explaining what your students will be handling.

All blockly tasks block oriented are defined as in the image below, which represents a basic task.


* At the top of the image you can see the title and context of the task.
* **TOOL BOX**: To complete the task, the student has a set of blocks, present in the **Tool Box**, the student can drag and drop blocks from the **Tool Box** to the **Workspace**. When you set up the task as a teacher, you decide which blocks are available in the **toolbox**.
* **WORKSPACE**: **Workspace** is where the blocks are placed to solve the task. When setting up the task as a teacher, you decide which blocks are available in the **workspace**.
* The **"Run Code"** button allows the student to run the blocks in the workspace. To run the code multiple times, the student must press the button again when it says **"Restart "** and then **"Run Code "** again.
* 2. The three buttons **"Blocks / Split / Text "** allow the student to show/hide an interface, showing the Python code equivalent to the blocks currently in the **workspace**. The **"Split "** button displays the interface on the right. By default it is set to **"Blocks "**, which shows only the blocks. The interface showing the code is not editable.
* 3. The interface showing the Python code equivalent of the blocks in the workspace.
* 4. In order to test his solution, the student must press **Submit**. Pressing **"Run Code "** only shows the effect of the blocks. The **Submit** button triggers the evaluation scripts, showing the feedback you decided to set based on the student's response (the evaluation system is discussed in more detail later in this tutorial).
* 5. The submission history at the bottom left allows the student to find their previous attempts and run them again.
* 6. This shows some information about the task and the student's progress.
